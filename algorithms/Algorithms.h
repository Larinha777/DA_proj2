 * @brief Solves the Knapsack Problem using a Brute Force approach
 * 
 * This function tries all possible subsets of items to find the combination
 * that yields the highest profit without exceeding the specified weight limit.
 *
 * @param ds Reference to the data structure containing the available items.
 * @param maxWeight The maximum allowed total weight for the selected items.
 * @param selectedItems Output vector that will contain pointers to the selected items in the optimal subset.
 * @return The maximum profit achievable without exceeding the weight constraint.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(2^n) where n is the number of items
 * Space complexity: O(1) excluding the output vector
 *
 * @note This implementation uses bitmasking with an unsigned long long for efficiency,
 * which limits the number of items to 64 (due to the 64-bit size).
 * This is not a real limitation in practice, since brute-force has exponential
 * complexity and becomes too slow for more than ~25â€“30 items. (ex dataset5 would take around 10 min)
